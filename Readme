The project is composed of two parts, the first a parser which uses and preprocesses the data from the UK BIObank.
The second a counterfactual prediction model

res.py file contains the results of our analysis

the base counterfactual model was taken from the great article yang22i, "https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06468"
____ using the model ____

* set use_full_dataset - True means full dataset False means mini(5000)

* set use_vaildation - to split test into valid as well (only relevant with optuna)
* set train ,test split - validate will be half of test(for now)


* to get model prediction use predict func

* to get gates - use get_gates func
